# The equation, solved for what actually varies

## The question

`k3-model-equation.md` states the model as one composed expression and says of its
section 1.1:

> That is the entire input. Everything else is a constant of the model.

If that sentence is taken literally, then every symbol in the equation is either a function
of the input or it is not, and the ones that are not have a value that could be determined
once and never again. This document works through the equation symbol by symbol and decides
which is which.

**The method is the equation, not measurement.** Nothing here is established by timing a
run or by reading a byte count. A symbol is run-invariant if its defining expression
contains no input symbol, transitively. That is a property of the text, and it is decidable
by inspection.

The previous documents in this series asked where time goes and how the bytes move.
This one asks a question that does not depend on either: **what does a run actually have to
compute, and what has it already been told?**

## The classification

Every symbol gets exactly one of four labels, assigned by what its definition depends on.

| label | means | determined |
|---|---|---|
| **E** | fixed by the equation itself | before any model exists |
| **W** | a function of the weights and nothing else | when the checkpoint is chosen |
| **R** | depends on $T$ or on some $t_p$, transitively | every run |
| **S** | carried state: **R**-valued in general, with an **E** initial value | every run, evolving |

The rules that assign them:

1. A symbol whose definition mentions only numerals and other **E** symbols is **E**.
2. A symbol whose definition mentions only **E** and **W** symbols is **W**.
3. A symbol whose definition mentions any **R** or **S** symbol is **R**.
4. The input symbols $T$ and $t_p$ are **R** by definition.
5. A symbol defined by a recurrence over positions, with an initial value that is **E**, is
   **S**.

Rule 2 is the one that does work. A quantity can be written inside the per-run part of the
expression and still be **W**, because what decides the label is the *dependency*, not the
*position in the text*. Every such symbol is a value the equation permits to be computed
once and reused for every run for the lifetime of the checkpoint.

The interesting output of this document is therefore not the **E** list, which is trivial,
nor the **R** list, which is most of the equation. It is the **W** list: the symbols that
look like work and are not.
